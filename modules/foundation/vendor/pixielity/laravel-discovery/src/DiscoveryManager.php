/**
 * DiscoveryManager - Main service class for class discovery operations.
 *
 * This class provides the core discovery functionality with proper dependency injection.
 * It acts as a factory for creating DiscoveryBuilder instances configured with different
 * discovery strategies (attribute, directory, interface, parent class).
 *
 * All strategies are created through the injected StrategyFactory, ensuring proper
 * dependency injection throughout the discovery process.
 *
 * The manager is registered as a singleton in the service container and should be
 * accessed through the Discovery facade for a cleaner API, or injected directly
 * into classes that need discovery functionality.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```php
 * // Via facade
 * Discovery::attribute(AsCard::class)->get();
 *
 * // Via dependency injection
 * public function __construct(DiscoveryManager $discovery) {
 *     $this->discovery = $discovery;
 * }
 * ```
