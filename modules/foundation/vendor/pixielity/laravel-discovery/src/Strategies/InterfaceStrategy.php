/**
 * InterfaceStrategy - Discovers classes implementing an interface.
 *
 * This strategy finds all classes that implement a specified interface. It can operate
 * in two modes:
 *
 * 1. **Global Mode**: Scans all declared classes in memory using `get_declared_classes()`
 * 2. **Directory Mode**: Scans specific directories for better performance and precision
 *
 * The directory mode is recommended for production use as it's more efficient and doesn't
 * rely on classes being already loaded into memory.
 *
 * ## Usage Examples:
 *
 * ```php
 * // Global mode - scans all declared classes
 * $strategy = new InterfaceStrategy(HealthCheckInterface::class);
 * $classes = $strategy->discover();
 *
 * // Directory mode - scans specific directories
 * $strategy = new InterfaceStrategy(HealthCheckInterface::class, $strategyFactory);
 * $strategy->directories('packages/*\/src/Health');
 * $classes = $strategy->discover();
 * ```
 *
 * ## Performance Considerations:
 * - Global mode: Fast but requires classes to be autoloaded
 * - Directory mode: Slower initial scan but more reliable and doesn't require autoloading
